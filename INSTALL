Quick guide:
 This guide assumes you have working build environments for PIC16F32 and avr already...
 - Try ./install-prereqs otherwise


You probably wont be able to build ampduino and maintain prebuilt firmwares, ymmv.

Build
-----
	If you wish to use pre-built firmwares, use 'make clean' instead of 'make distclean' below.

	* Clean source tree
		make distclean

	* Edit configurations as needed:
		- ampduino_config.h
		- board.mk
		- atu100/config.h
		- ubitx/board.mk
		- ubitx/defines.h

	* Build everything, including firmware
		make world

Install
-------
	* Connect PICKit3 to atu-100 board and PC

	* Upload firmware to ATU-100
		make install-atu100

	* Disconnect PICKit3 from PC and atu-100 board

	* Connect ubitx arduino nano to PC usb

	* Upload firmware to ubitx
		make install-ubitx

	* Disconnect USB from ubitx arduino and PC

	* Connect mega2560 to USB

	* Upload firmware to ampduino
		make install-ampduino

	* Disconnect mega2560 from USB and PC

	* Connect the boards as shown elsewhere in docs/ and enjoy!
