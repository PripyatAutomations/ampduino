This is a modified version of N7DDC's ATU-100 firmware to support usage
inside an AmpDuino build. It won't be very useful for stand-alone units...

It appears to build successfully on devuan and ubuntu.

* Original readme.md_ *
Started with 1938_EXT_board_sources_V_3.2 which compiles only under MikroC and ported them to MPLAB.
this should still compile successfully under MikroC also
