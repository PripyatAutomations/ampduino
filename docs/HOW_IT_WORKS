Various cheap kits are cobbled together with an arduino mega2560 and a handful of cheap components.

Right now the following features are the only ones that will work:
	* Amplifier (Mini-PA 70/100) PTT
	* Auto-tuner (ATU-100) SWR reading and control
	* RV3YKF 9 band Low Pass Filter kit (TX LPF) control

Eventually I'll find time to make things more generic, but for now, you'll need to hack the code
a bit to make it work with your build... Good luck!


Work is in progress to build a menuconfig-like tool for configuring the image.


Either use 'make world' if you have xc8 installed and want to rebuild all firmware or
'make' to build just ampduino firmware.
