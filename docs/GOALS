* Build a completely open source 100W HF radio based
* Keep total station costs, excluding feedline and antennaes under $500

  Approximate parts costs when ordered:
	- ubitx v6			- $150
	- Raspberry Pi 4b 8gb		- $70
	- ATU-100 Tuner Kit		- $40
	- RV3YKF LPF filter kit		- $42

	- Enclosure			- $6
			Total: $461

Yes, I could buy a smaller, fancier prebuilt radio for slightly more, but this has been
built in stages as I progressed in my hobby. Why settle for a closed source radio system
or QRP in 2022?

Ideally this will save someone else a bit of trouble ;)


Thanks to N3RYB for donating ubitx v6 to the project!

Developed on Devuan aarch64, ymmv elsewhere.


So far we've reduced ubitx firmware (N8ME firmware derived) from ~30kbytes down
to 9kbytes to make room for ampduino, built most of the kits, and started on
this mess you are viewing now ;)
