there aren't many instructions available for these kits..

here's how i built mine and some tips:


TIPS
----
* SMD Capacitors, the BLACK marking goes TOWARD the square side (away from the different side).

* When building transformers: Solder quickly, then take your time allowing ferrites to cool before starting another solder.

* Try to keep transformers flat...

Building
--------

I installed parts in following order

	* Relay - Bend legs to match PCB, tin a corner and place.

	* SMA connectors for LPF IN/LPF out (NOT included)

	* SMA connectors for IN/OUT (included)

	* PTT connector

	* LPF bypass jumper

	* Build and install choke L1
		- 2 turns
	  *** The enamel is VERY easy to scratch off while winding, be careful

	* SMD caps

	* Build transformers

	* Mount transformers
		* Large one (output) has 3 windings
		* Small one (input) has 2 windings

	* Wind transformers

	* Install transistors

	* Inspect/improve solder mask on bottom of board with nail polish as needed

	* Mount to heat sink
